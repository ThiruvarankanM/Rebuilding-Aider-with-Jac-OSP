## üéØ Judges' Questions - Prepared Answers

**Q: "How is this different from existing AI assistants?"**
A: "Existing tools process code linearly and require manual guidance. Our OSP approach analyzes spatial relationships between code elements, enabling autonomous operation. It's the difference between a calculator and a thinking machine."

**Q: "Can you prove this actually works?"**
A: "Absolutely. [show live integration test] This is real, working code. 17 Jac modules, complete Python integration, autonomous workflows from task description to validated implementation."

**Q: "What's the business impact?"**
A: "Three key impacts: 45% efficiency improvement in token usage means direct cost savings. Autonomous operation means faster development cycles. Spatial analysis means better code quality. ROI is immediate and measurable."

**Q: "How scalable is this approach?"**
A: "OSP scales with complexity - the more complex the codebase, the more valuable spatial analysis becomes. We've designed this for enterprise-scale repositories, not just toy examples."
