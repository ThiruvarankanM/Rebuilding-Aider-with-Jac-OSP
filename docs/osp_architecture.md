# OSP Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The **OSP (Optimized Software Planning)** module is a foundational component in the Aider system.  
It provides structured representations of a repository and enables advanced code analysis, traversal, and ranking.

OSP transforms a code repository into a **graph of nodes**, representing:

- Files (`CodeFile`)
- Classes (`ClassNode`)
- Functions (`FunctionNode`)
- Imports (`ImportNode`)

Each node is connected to related nodes to form a **spatial graph** capturing code dependencies and relationships.

---

## Key Components

### 1. RepoMap
- Central class representing the repository structure.
- Contains all file nodes and provides methods to:
  - Load repository files
  - Traverse nodes
  - Query specific functions, classes, or imports

### 2. File Nodes
- `CodeFile`: Represents a source code file
- `FunctionNode`: Represents a function within a file
- `ClassNode`: Represents a class within a file
- `ImportNode`: Represents an import statement and dependency

### 3. Spatial Graph
- Nodes are linked according to relationships:
  - Function calls
  - Class inheritance
  - File imports
- Enables graph-based algorithms like ranking and change impact analysis

### 4. Graph Walkers
- Specialized traversal mechanisms over the RepoMap graph:
  - `DependencyWalker`
  - `ImpactWalker`
  - `PlanningWalker`

### 5. Algorithms & Utilities
- Ranking algorithms for prioritizing files and functions
- Token optimization for intelligent prompt construction
- Multi-file change coordination and impact analysis

## Usage Flow

1. **Load Repository**
```python
from aider.jac.integration.osp_interface import OSPInterface
osp = OSPInterface()
osp.load_repo(".")
````

2. **Traverse Nodes**

```python
for node in osp.repo_map.get_all_nodes():
    print(node.name, node.type, node.file.path)
```

3. **Rank Files**

```python
ranked_files = osp.rank_files()
for f in ranked_files[:10]:
    print(f.path, f.score)
```

4. **Analyze Impact**

```python
impacted_nodes = osp.analyze_changes(["file1.py", "file2.py"])
```

---

## Integration Points

* Used by **genius\_agent.jac** for autonomous planning
* Provides context for **MTP prompts**
* Feeds data to **editor and validation walkers**

---

## Notes

* Supports multi-language repos via `file extension` detection.
* Node graphs are cached for performance.
* Designed for extensibility: additional node types and walkers can be added easily.
